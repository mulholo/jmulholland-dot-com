title: 'Thoughts'

Here you can find a collection of my interests and beliefs. On the
semi-anonymous internet, it's a way I can tell you a bit about myself.

I also track this page in
[git](https://github.com/mulholo/jmulholland-dot-com/) so that I have
a log of how these evolve over time.

## Interests

### Programming

Learning to code is the best example I know of a positive feedback
loop: the more you learn, the more you want to learn. It is my
favourite method for obtaining
[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow) and
is one of the most consistent tools I have for lifting my mood. I like
getting better at all aspects of software development, whether that's
learning new languages, new technologies, [Vim](https://vim.org) (yes,
you should learn it), or boosting my typing speed (honed to >100wpm
with my touch typing app for developers,
[TypePerf](https://typeperf.com)).

### AI

I first became interested in AI during my philosophy degree where I
built my first neural network in order to better understand
epistemological issues in deep learning, and researched
decision-theoretic approaches to AI safety for my dissertation. I'm
fascinated by AI's ability to be a fountain of ideas and hope one day
to be able to turn some of these ideas into impactful projects. For
now, I'm mostly enjoying learning lots of maths, messing around with
projects in PyTorch, and
[building bots to beat my housemates at Articulate](https://twitter.com/mulholo/status/1337415080980439041).

### Design

As well as in a professional capacity whilst building web products, I
have an interest in design more generally. I have a tendency to see a
lot of life as a design problem that can be solved. Mostly, however,
this simply involves getting angry about
[Norman Doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI) and poorly
designed cycle lanes. My favourite designs are the
[Finnish drying rack/cupboard hybrid](https://99percentinvisible.org/article/finnish-dishes-simple-nordic-design-beats-dishwashers-drying-racks/)
and [Dieter Rams' 606 Shelving Unit](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/606).

### Philosophy

I studied philosophy at university and I think of it as a fantastic
lens through which you can view everything else in life. It is a
foundation that prompts you to examine first principles and its
methodology of precise examination feels infinitely applicable. There
are instances where it is specifically and pragmatically useful (e.g.
[truth-tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table) making
programming logic easier) and also when it helps improve broader
skills (e.g. in the ability to construct a well-formed argument).

### Effective Altruism

Tangental to Philosophy, I am keenly interested in the
[Effective Alturism](https://effectivealtruism.org) movement (perhaps
more as a mode of thinking than a community). If you haven't heard of
EA, this
[article](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/),
this
[talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/will_macaskill_how_can_we_do_the_most_good_for_the_world?language=en)
or this
[book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1592409105)
are good places to start. If you're more interested in making an
impact through your career, make sure to check out
[80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/).

### Meta-learning, Productivity, Tools for Thought

When I learned to code while simultaneously studying for my degree, I
became increasingly interested in meta-learning (learning how to
learn) and its power to exponentially boost all other skills. I am
also continuously refining my productivity systems and am a big fan of
[Roam](https://roamresearch.com/),
[PARA](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/),
and [pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
These are areas I am constantly working and I always seek new ways of
improving focus, knowledge retention and skill-acquisition.

### Art

Art is an area of my life that is infinitely valuable yet seems
neglected in many tech circles. Here's a list of some of my favourite
art forms and artists. Please send me any of your favourites as I find
this the best way to discover new things I like!

## Beliefs

I find the act of explicitly articulating your beliefs clarifies them
and separates the important from the trivial. This list is an ongoing
attempt to do that.

- Most of your impact on the world is in the long-term future and this
  has profound, counter-intuitive consequences for the decisions you
  make.
- Life is short, important, urgent and precious.
- Good hard is fun, bad hard is terrible. Embrace the former, prepare
  for the latter.
- [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow),
  remembering your own mortality, love, friendship and impact are all
  essential components of a meaningful life.
- Politics is an ineffective vehicle for change for 80% of people. Of
  course, _some_ people should be interested in politics but for most
  it serves only as a talking point on which action is never taken.
- You should probably block news content. You're better off consuming
  higher-quality information like (good) books that will be useful for
  a longer period of time. If something is truly important news,
  you'll hear about it anyway.
- You should live your life in an
  [anti-fragile](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225)
  way.
- Decision theory is (almost?) always a waste of time.
- ~~Free will is an illusion.~~ I am a compatabilist about free will.
- ~~Utilitarianism is a very good heuristic for living your life by.
  I'm not completely sure on its foundations, however.~~ I am
  currently less sure on even this belief. Currently under
  investigation so if you have any good meta-ethics/moral
  foundations/moral disagrement recommendations, please email me! I'm
  hoping that
  [Reasons and Persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_and_Persons)
  will magicaly sort this out for me.
