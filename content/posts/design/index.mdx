_This is a meta-page on the design of this website. It contains
details on typography, layout and design, and showcases
[jmulholland.com](/)'s interesting and novel features. This page is
also personally useful to me as I test, tweak and refine the details
below._

_All code for this website is open source, and you are welcome to
[view it on GitHub](https://github.com/mulholo/jmulholland-dot-com)._

## Typography

### Typefaces

Body text is styled in a stack of `Charter, Georgia, serif`. I wanted
a serif typeface for readability, and chose this selection to utilise
pre-installed system fonts and avoid additional network requests.

I also use a system font stack for my monospaced fonts:
`Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, Liberation Mono, Lucida Console, monospace`.

Elsewhere, predominantly for headings, I use
[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). It is similar to Helvetica in its
clean, classic feel, but works much better in digital formats.

### Scale

Font sizes (as well as many other dimensions of the site) are
determined by a programmatically generated scale using the
[golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

This approach keeps sizing consistent across the size, and provides a
pleasant visual hierarchy.

They also incorporate a slight size change based upon the viewport
width so that text expands on bigger screens and shrinks on smaller
ones.

### Measure

The width of text columns (also known as the measure) is set using the
rule of thumb that it should be approximately 2-3 alphabets in length.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz|abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz|abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

This provides a good balance between making your eyes lose their place
when jumping through long lines and breaking up text too much with
short lines.

### Bullet Points

- Specific bullet point styling has been taken into account. You'll
  notice that it works well with longer, multi-line bullet points like
  this one...
- ...and also short ones such as this.

### Numbered Lists

1. Numbered lists can also be added.
2. They look like this.

### Quotes

Large display quotes can be added like so:

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
> when there is nothing left to take away."
>
> <footer>Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, Airman's Odyssey</footer>

### Body Links

Of course, body text would not be complete without good link styling.
They [look like this](/design).

## Heading Links

Headings contain links that appear on hover. This is useful for
sharing links to particular sections of text.

## Inline Tweets

Tweets can be displayed inline.

## Footnotes

<FootnoteParagraphWrapper>
  <p>
    We can add footnotes into paragraphs.<FootnoteN>1</FootnoteN>{' '}
    These allow me to add extra details or references where
    appropriate. I like the way they add context without being a
    distraction from the main text.<FootnoteN>2</FootnoteN> On mobile,
    I use a novel design of slide-in footnotes that are triggered by
    tapping the footnote in body text.
  </p>
  <FootnoteStack>
    <Footnote n={1}>
      Footnotes are always visible on larger screens or are tucked
      away behind a toggle on smaller screens.
    </Footnote>
    <Footnote n={2}>
      You can happily stack as many footnotes as you like.
    </Footnote>
  </FootnoteStack>
</FootnoteParagraphWrapper>

## Images

It's easy to add images, with or without captions, to body text.

Performant images are loaded progressively. Give the page a refresh to
observe the brief blur effect as an image loads.

## Sections

I can separate sections with a `---` in markdown, like so:

## Code

### Inline

Inline code can be added like this: `const f = () => 42`.

### Block

The site also supports code blocks with language-specific syntax
highlighting and a custom colour theme.

```ts
interface Foo {
  bar: string
}

const foo: Foo = {
  bar: 'baz',
}

type Baz = Foo | never

class Car extends Vehicle() {
  public async beep(): Promise<string> {
    return Promise.resolve('beep!')
  }
}

/**
 * Demonstrates syntax highlighting
 */
export async function someFunc() {
  const url = 'https://jmulholland.com'
  const x = url.length

  const condition = true
  if (condition) {
    return x + 2
  }

  return x
}

for (const x of y) {
  window.alert(x)
}
```

## MDX

This site uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). This means I not only get
the benefits of writing in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but I can
also insert whatever customer React component I want, right in the
middle of a piece of text.

### `<Concept />`

Sometimes, I want to highlight a concept in the body of a text, to
highlight a proper term, much like you would see illustrated with
small caps in a philosophy essay. I use my custom MDX `<Concept />`
component to achieve this. e.g. <Concept>Concept</Concept>.

## Editing

All code and content on this site is hosted on GitHub. I can easily
edit content on the go using the brilliant
[Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/) app.

its sources of inspiration. I am particular grateful for the following
resources:

## Future Features

At some point, you must ship whatever you have in an unfinished state.
That said, in the future, I would love to add the following features
to the site:

- Spellchecking system (ideally through CI on GitHub).
- Twitter cards
- Aside/call-out sections
- Hanging typography
