title: "I've Been Writing CSS Wrong Part 1: The Layout Component"

import { Concept } from '/src/components'

Over the past month or so, I've thought a lot about CSS. Thanks to
[some tweets](https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1254541122946228224?s=20),
watching
[Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag),
the excellent [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) and discussion
with other engineers, I've come to the dramatic conclusion that I've
been writing CSS wrong.

In summary, the mistakes I have been making can be described as the
following: ignoring the fact that good programming principles
([composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance),
[separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns),
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), minimise
API surface area) still apply to CSS.

Ignoring this point isn't catastrophic. You will still be able to
style components as desired. However, only applying good architecture
and programming principles to code, and not CSS, will increase
complexity, suck time into fighting bugs, and have you writing a lot
of boilerplate. In this three-part series, I'll be looking at some
approaches to improving the situation:

1. Utilise the <Concept>Layout Component</Concept>
2. Adapt styles with <Concept>style props</Concept>, not ad hoc CSS
3. Use <Concept>Intrinsic Styling</Concept>

While the position these principles have got me to is certainly not
perfect, they have made things dramatically better. Instead of
reimplementing the same patterns over and over again, I reach for
ready-made solutions. Styling has fewer bugs as reusable solutions are
thought out in advanced. Designs look great at _all_ screen sizes.
Most importantly, however, I have a far clearer view of the overall
structure of the DOM and my styling. I feel like an architect, not a
builder.

<p>
  In this post, we'l examine the first approach: the{' '}
  <Concept>Layout Component</Concept>.
</p>

## What is the Layout Component?

<p>
  Most component libraries will contain some collection of buttons,
  inputs, forms, and date-pickers. These are what we traditionally
  call 'components' and they have a satisfying, visible tangibility to
  them. However, as any good front-end developer knows, there are
  other kinds of components tooâ€”
  <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html'>
    higher-order components
  </a>, <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#use-render-props-for-cross-cutting-concerns'>
    render-prop components
  </a>, and <a href='https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0'>
    containers
  </a> to name but a few. In this post, I shall introduce a new category
  of component that I've seen appear in various component libraries: the
  <Concept>Layout Component</Concept>. The{' '}
  <Concept> Layout Component</Concept> abstracts the responsive
  spacing and arrangement patterns used in your app. It renders and
  styles `children`, yet provides no direct functionality or styling
  if used in isolation. In other words, the Higher-order Component is
  to logic as the <Concept>Layout Component</Concept> is to styling.
</p>

## A Simple Example: The Stack

<FootnoteParagraphWrapper>
  <p>
    One of the simplest ways to illustrate the{' '}
    <Concept>Layout Component</Concept> is with the{' '}
    <code class='language-text'>{'<Stack />'}</code>.
    <FootnoteN>1</FootnoteN> The{' '}
    <code class='language-text'>{'<Stack />'}</code> has one job: take
    an array of children and arrange them next to one another.
  </p>
  <FootnoteStack>
    <Footnote n={1}>
      SwiftUI has my favourite implementation of the Stack. It can
      also be found within{' '}
      <a href='https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/stack#navigation'>
        Polaris
      </a>
      , <a href='https://every-layout.dev/'>Every Layout</a> and <Link to='/figma-auto-layout'>
        Figma auto-layout
      </Link>.
    </Footnote>
  </FootnoteStack>
</FootnoteParagraphWrapper>

```jsx
<Stack>
  <ChildOne />
  <ChildTwo />
  {/* ... */}
  <ChildN />
</Stack>
```

You can also add some spacing, if you so desire.

```jsx
<Stack spacing='1rem'>
  <ChildOne />
  <ChildTwo />
  {/* ... */}
  <ChildN />
</Stack>
```

![The stack, spaced](stack-spaced.jpg)

The Stack occurs all over UI. I have used the Stack to lay out form
elements, paragraphs of text, and navigation links. Once you consider
horizontal stacks, allowing spacing between elements, padding, and
different item alignment options, it is amazing how far this one
component gets you.

## Benefits of the Layout Component

<p>
  Layout components like the <code>{`<Stack />`}</code> reduce
  boilerplate and make your team more productive. They provide
  off-the-shelf solutions to common layout problems, thus ensuring
  high-quality design and cleaner code through consistency. However,
  the biggest benefit I find with the
  <Concept>Layout Component</Concept> is that you are forced to write good
  CSS. When you write CSS for many screens, not one, you take more care.
  Furthermore, designing a component for many situations makes your CSS
  more robust as you have to think of edge cases up front.
</p>

## Writing CSS the Layout Component Way

Although the Layout Component is simple in theory, it does lead to
some initially counter-intuitive approaches to developing UI.

### Padding Over Margin

<FootnoteParagraphWrapper>
  <p>
    First, it will soon be noted that applying margin directly to
    child components is usually an anti-pattern in the world of the
    Layout Component. Margin applies spacing from the children in your
    layout whereas padding applies spacing from the parent (the Layout
    Component). Since which children are used is specific to the
    situation but layout components are generic, using margin is an ad
    hoc solution.<FootnoteN>2</FootnoteN>
  </p>
  <FootnoteStack>
    <Footnote n={2}>
      Max Stoiber has further thoughts on this topic of no margin{' '}
      <a href='https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin'>here</a>.
    </Footnote>
  </FootnoteStack>
</FootnoteParagraphWrapper>

The exception here is when you apply margin from the parent and treat
it like padding. The
[lobotomised owl](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1251841866242367488?s=20)
technique uses this principle, for example.

### Intrinsic Over Extrinsic

Second, most components should not be sized intrinsically. Rather,
they should either expand according to their content or their
container. Defining rigid component sizing is a sure-fire way to make
your UI brittle. Defining components which fill their container or
expand according to their content is far safer (see part 3 in this
series for more on this).

### Generic Over Custom

<FootnoteParagraphWrapper>
  <p>
    The third paradigm shift in the transition to{' '}
    <Concept>Layout Component</Concept> CSS is that you should find
    yourself writing very little custom CSS. If you do find yourself
    writing one-off CSS, perhaps it is time to see if you can come up
    with a more reusable solution.<FootnoteN>3</FootnoteN>
  </p>
  <FootnoteStack>
    <Footnote n={3}>
      Counterintuitively, I've found the best way to encourage correct
      abstraction into parameterised layout components is to write
      inline styles (
      <a href='https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1251218278434791424?s=20'>
        thanks to this thread from Jamie Kyle
      </a>
      ) . Markup-muddying inline styling screams in your face that you
      need to be doing some refactoring and is an excellent incentive to
      move more CSS into your design system.

The ideal of the <Concept>Layout Component</Concept> is to have all
your UI pre-made, and as easy to construct as Lego. Of course, this is
an **ideal**, not a reality, but it is a good one to strive for.
