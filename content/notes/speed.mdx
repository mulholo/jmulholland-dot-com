Going fast has unappreciated benefits:

- Speed gets you where you want quicker (obvious).
- Speed not only allows you to complete the same activities faster,
  but also unlocks completely new activities. For example, faster
  typing unlocks the ability to take a transcript rather than bullet
  point notes.
- Speed increases learning by passing through more feedback loops.
- Speed shortens backlogs. When you do things quicker, you avoid the
  overhead that comes from having to postpone tasks until later. You
  can simply do them _now_.
- Speed allows you to complete tasks in a reduced number of sessions,
  which reduces the switching cost incurred when repeatedly picking up
  and dropping work.
- A small speed increase in the short term could result in huge
  increases in the long term due to the effect of compounding
  improvements.

Successful startups seem to prioritise speed to an extraordinary
degree:

- Facebook has made famous the "move fast and break things" mentality.

- Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, collects
  [a great list of "fast" projects](https://patrickcollison.com/fast).

- Patrick McKenzie on what it is like to work at Stripe:

  > The returns to pushing your cadence to faster are everywhere and
  > they compound continuously, for years. Don’t send the email
  > tomorrow. Don’t default to scheduling the meeting for next week.
  > Don’t delay a worthy sprint until after the next quarterly
  > planning exercise. Design control and decisionmaking structures to
  > bias heavily in favor of preserving operating cadence.

  > A stupendous portion of that advantage is just consistently
  > choosing to get more done. That sounds vacuous but hasn’t been in
  > my experience. I have seen truly silly improvements occasioned by
  > someone just consistently asking in meetings “Could we do that
  > faster? What is the minimum increment required to ship? Could that
  > be done faster?”
