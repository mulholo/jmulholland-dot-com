Regular indexed keys and the [`STORING` clause](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/secondary-indexes#storing-clause)
serve very similar purposes in Google Cloud Spanner.

For example, let's consider this table which describes completable tasks.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks
  created_by_user_id STRING(36) NOT NULL,
  # e.g. "Buy milk"
  content STRING(MAX),
  # "HIGH" | "LOW"
  priority STRING(MAX),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
```

Let's imagine we want to show the current user all their tasks for a given priority. One way we
can speed up this query is by creating the following index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX
  active_tasks_by_priority_idx
ON
  user (
    created_by_user_id,
    completed_at,
    priority
  )
```

Alternatively, we could have `priority` in a `STORING` clause instead of in the index keys.

```sql
CREATE INDEX
  active_tasks_by_priority_idx
ON
  user (
    created_by_user_id,
    completed_at
  ) STORING (
    priority
  )
```

The advantage of adding `STORING` over an index with just the other two keys is that it removes the
need to join on the base `tasks` table which makes the query cheaper as `priority` is colocated with
the index. If we did not store `priority`, Spanner would have to look at the values in our index then
go to the base `tasks` table to look up the `priority` value.

But adding `priority` to the indexed keys would also avoid having to look up the value in the base
table. Let's imagine our app limits the user to three active (`compelted_at IS NOT NULL`) HIGH
priority tasks and five active MEDIUM priority tasks (focus is important). This means that when we
create a new task, we need to first do a read inside a read-write transaction to avoid a task being
created which exceeds the task limit, then do our write to create the task. What is the difference
between using indexed keys and `STORING` if we create one HIGH priority task then one MEDIUM priority
task?

If `STORING` is used and we create a new HIGH priority task, the transaction will lock all rows
matching the specified `created_by_user_id` and `completed_at` values. i.e. All user task creation
will be locked, regardless of priority. This means that the subsequent MEDIUM priority task creation
will be blocked.

If `priority` is an indexed key, on the other hand, the transaction will only lock rows which match
the queried `priority`. Consequently, the MEDIUM priority task creation will not be blocked.

This is a trivial example where the blocking is minimal. However, with larger amounts of data, this
difference can cause serious performance issues.

Also note that [read-only transactions do not acquire locks](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/introspection/lock-statistics)
so this difference only applies to read-write transactions.

## Open Questions

- `STORING` comes at the cost of extra storage space vs not using `STORING`. However, this is also true
of additional index keys. What is the difference in cost here?
- How can we illustrate this with the query planner?
- Why don't we always use indexed keys if they come with reduced locking costs?
- How does `INTERLEAVE` fit in here? Like `STORING`, it is an approach to reduce join costs.
