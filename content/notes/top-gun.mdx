After excessive losses in air combat over Vietnam, the US Navy wanted
to train pilots. However, they had a problem: no one knew what made
the best pilots best.

To solve this, they skipped the 'why' and instead set up the United
States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (popularly known
as TOPGUN) which instead aimed to replicate real-world dogfights as
closely as possible.

Equally, in knowledge work, a relatively recent discipline, we ofte
don't know what good looks like. However, it is often possible to set
up practice situations which resemble the job as closely as possible
and improve from there.

To do Top Gun Learning yourself:

1. Replicate the real world situation you are trying to train for as
   closely as possible
2. Minimise the cost of failure
3. Don't worry too much about 'why', just practice.
4. Provide lots of feedback
