## Getting your license (in the UK)

Getting your motorcycle license is far trickier than getting your car
license. Not only are bikes harder to ride, the regulation around them
is much more strenuous. Here’s the full process I went through to be
able to ride my motorbike:

1. CBT
2. Theory test
3. Mod 1 (off-road) practical test
4. Mod 2 (on-road) practical test

This is a lot of tests and a lot of expense. What’s more, each stage
blocks the next one (you can’t do mod 1 until you’ve passed your CBT
and theory, you can’t do mod 2 until you’ve passed mod 1). The whole
process took me about 3 months, this being particularly slow due to
learning in the summer (the busiest time) and the UK having lots of
instructor strikes while I was learning.

The CBT is a combination of basic safety training, some off-road
riding to get you to grips with the basics of bike control, clutch and
shifting gears, and then an on-road segment where you are assessed to
be safe enough to go out on the road and ride. Passing this will let
you ride a 125cc scooter/motorcycle with L plates for two years.

I had assumed that the CBT was impossible to fail. In practice, out of
the four people in my group, two failed completely, one was coming
back to retry after a previous failure, and one passed first time
(me). I suspect this varies a lot by instructor.

The theory is the most straightforward test. It’s half
multiple-choice, half hazard perception (clicking when you spot a
hazard in a video of driving along the road). I’d recommend
downloading one of the driving theory apps and just studying the
flashcards on there. I booked mine about five days in advance and got
nearly full marks from about half an hour of studying a day. Although
it’s easy to pass, you need to study as they ask you for some obscure
knowledge that you’ll never encounter otherwise (e.g. what do you do
with a sidecar on a motorcycle, obscure signage). There’s also a knack
to passing the hazard awareness tests.

Mod 1 tests off-road bike control. You’ll do a series of pre-defined
manoeuvres such as figures of eight, u-turns and emergency braking.

Mod 2 is the on-road test. You’ll ride around for half an hour,
followed by an instructor, and your task is more or less not to commit
any road offences. If you’ve passed your Mod 1 and have driven or
cycled before (I.e. have good road awareness), you’ll probably find
this test quite easy.

This is the straightforward path to a full A license (the license
where you can ride any size bike). If you’re under 24 or think you can
only handle a smaller bike, you can also take your test on smaller
bikes and, subsequently, only gain an A1 or A2 license that will
restrict you to smaller engine sizes. I’d really recommend going for
the full A if you’re old enough, as you’ll only have to take more
tests later and I found the full A bikes I learned on relatively easy
to manage.

Riding around on a 125 for a year once you have your CBT is also a
reasonable idea as this can increase your odds of passing your test,
keep your insurance down when you get a big bike, and let you get
comfortable with riding at a lower cost. I ruled this out as, at 6’4”,
a 125cc bike was a no-go.

## Taking Lessons and Learning to Pass

How long it will take you to pass your tests will depend on a lot of
factors. Here is an incomplete list of things that will help you learn
to ride, ranked roughly in order of importance.

- You’ve been riding a 125 with your CBT
- You’ve ridden motorcycles off-road before e.g. motocross
- You are a cyclist, especially if you ride busy, urban roads or have
  a good understanding of grip from mountain biking
- You are a driver, especially if using a manual transmission
- You have a natural inclination for motorcycle riding
- You’ve got a basic understanding of bike controls from online
  learning/YouTube videos

A day of mod 1 training and a day of mod 2 training is probably the
smallest amount of training you could get away with. With decent
cycling and car experience and no motorbike experience, I had two days
(10am-4pm) of mod 1 training and one day of mod 2 training. I passed
everything the first time. I might have passed with a day less of mod
1 but, as I had time to kill waiting for my test, booking an extra day
in for confidence was a no-brainer.

You’ll find some schools give pay-as-you-go lessons, others book an
intensive week. I went for pay-as-you-go as this offered lower risk if
I failed anything, meant I’d only take the lessons I needed, and
because this is what the school nearest to me did. An intensive week
probably gives you the shortest calendar time to pass, but I don’t
think which route you pick is a big deal.

## Practicality (or lack thereof)

When I started learning to ride, I thought that my motorbike would be
the practical urban mode of transport of my dreams. No traffic! No
train cancellations! Direct to where I want to go! Cheap!

In reality, none of these features materialised. Although filtering
makes you much quicker than a car, you don’t have access to bike
lanes. London one-way systems are a nightmare, taking you on more
indirect routes than on a bicycle. Everywhere is 20mph and covered by
speed cameras. You have to pay for parking in many boroughs. You can’t
use your power in tight, London traffic. You won’t be able to ride
when your bike is in for a service. Insurance, gear, lessons and
maintenance (never mind the bike itself) are all incredibly expensive.

You probably can’t justify riding a motorcycle in London on practical
grounds (ride a bicycle instead). That said, I’m incredibly glad I’ve
learned to ride. The decision has shifted from a practical one to an
emotional one. My life feels so much better. Riding my bike is the
most fun I have, and I get up before work so I can sneak out to the
quietest roads I can find to ride.

A note on cost. Riding is expensive. I spent approximately £1000 on
lessons and tests, £1000 on gear, £3000 on a bike, £3000 on the first
year’s insurance, £800 on security, £100 on tax, and £500 on 6 months'
maintenance. This is excluding petrol. Of course, this is mostly
first-year startup costs and I hope to be able to get total expenses
down below £2000/year in a few years’ time. However, it’s still a lot
of money and I don’t think I appreciated just how much the costs would
rise when you add all the components up. I’ll explain some ways to
make this all cheaper in the bike, insurance, security and gear
sections below.

## What bike to get

You will spend night after night on the internet, browsing for bikes.
This is probably going to be the most stressful part of your journey.

Ultimately, which bike you pick is an incredibly personal decision. It
will depend on your ergonomics, personal taste, use case, finances,
age, location, storage options and a dozen other factors.

That said, I do have some general recommendations and advice that I
hope can save you some time, money, and sleepless nights.

First, don’t buy a sports bike. I just can’t see this being the right
choice for a first-time rider. You’ll be more comfortable and have
more fun on virtually any other kind of bike. This is especially true
for the big sports bikes (1000cc+). You can always switch later.

Second, you don’t need more than ~75HP/700cc. Anything more than this
is complete overkill for a beginner. My 74HP XSR700 has more power
than I know what to do with and is capable of overtaking any car in
the blink of an eye. I picked a big bike because I’m tall, but I’d
otherwise recommend going much smaller as this will save you lots of
money in bike and insurance, and you’ll also have a much smoother time
learning and filtering traffic.

Sit on your bike in person. I was amazed at how little the degree to
which bikes felt like they fit was not correlated to overall bike
size. You can very quickly rule out otherwise very desirable bikes
within thirty seconds of in-person contact.

I’d recommend buying used as you’ll likely drop your bike the first
year. I also literally could not find theft insurance quotes for new
bikes.

Here is a (very incomplete) list of good beginner bikes:

- Yamaha XSR700 (my bike)
- Yamaha MT-07
- Suzuki SV650
- Triumph Street Twin
- Yamaha XJ6
- Honda CB500F
- Honda CB500X
- BMW 310GS
- KTM Duke 390
- Ducati Monster

## How to buy your bike

### Buying New

Buying a new bike is obviously the lowest-risk option. Buying from a
dealership means you get a machine that is guaranteed to be in good
condition and can be specced exactly how you like. All of this comes
at a cost, of course, and you'll pay a premium for getting a new
machine. You'll also suffer depreciation costs the most, especially if
you trade up soon.

As a new rider, you'll need to be mindful that you probably won't be
able to test-ride any of the bikes. Without any insurance of your own,
this is also true of used bikes, however.

Depending on when you buy, you might be able to get a good offer from
a dealership (e.g. 0% finance, end-of-season discounts). As I was
buying at a high-interest rate period, there weren't a lot of good
deals to be had.

Whether you buy new or not, I'd recommend going into a dealership to
get some advice.

### Buying Used

As a new rider, you should probably be buying used. Everyone has told
me I'm likely to drop/crash my bike in my first year, and you'll lose
lots of value on a new bike for doing this. For an old bike, this is
less the case. As a first-time rider, you're likely to want something
different relatively soon while you find your feet and you don't want
to be paying more than needed on depreciation for a new machine.

There are four main places you'll be able to buy a motorbike in the
UK:

- Auto-trader
- Second-hand dealerships
- eBay
- Facebook Marketplace

Auto-trader is the best place to start looking. It will give you a
good idea of what the market is like and, as a motorcycle-specific
site, will give you the best options for browsing. Generally, I found
it a bit overpriced vs Facebook and eBay.

Auto-trader will link to lots of second-hand dealerships. These places
will also give you a bit more peace of mind when buying a machine as
their wares will likely have been serviced and inspected to a higher
level than Autotrader/eBay/Facebook private machines. You'll pay a bit
of a premium for this. Second-hand dealerships are a great place to
visit if you want to try on a large number of machines for size in a
short amount of time.

eBay's auction format means you can get some real steals (indeed, this
is where I bought my XSR700). I saw multiple machines go for 10-30%
below market value due to high competition/badly timed listings. The
flip side here is that you'll probably be bidding on a machine you
won't have a chance to view in person.

I suspect that most motorcycles are priced according to a simple
function of model, age, colour and miles. This means you can get some
real deals if you pay attention. Notably, I found that accessories,
garage/outdoor storage, service history, tyre wear and other such
factors were barely taken into account at all. If you can find a
machine which is the wrong colour, high-mileage but well-maintained
and looked after, you can get a lot more than you pay for. Looking
from the other side, you can get stung by not factoring in maintenance
when you buy. I had to fork out £500 for a service more or less as
soon as I'd bought my bike, and tyres a few months later.

A bonus tip: buying bikes at the end of the year is cheaper as few
people want to pick up riding for the winter.

### Middle-ground: Ex-demo

As a middle-ground between brand-new bikes and used ones, many
dealerships will have great deals on ex-demo bikes. These will more or
less be brand new, often with only a few hundred miles on the clock,
but can save you thousands off the asking price. I very nearly bought
an ex-demo Yamaha Ténéré that was an absolute steal. I found stock for
these bikes to be pretty low so you may have to travel for what you
want to buy.

## Insurance

The biggest price shock I had on my motorcycle journey was insurance.
Insurance prices were insane, reaching into the thousands a year when
I had expected hundreds. Of course, as an under-30, new rider in
London on a full A bike, things were going to be about as bad as they
could be.

There will be lots of things that contribute to your insurance price.
Here's roughly what I found the factors to be, ranked from most to
least important:

1. Rider age
2. No claims bonus
3. Location
4. Whether you are purchasing comprehensive/third-party and
   theft/third-party only insurance
5. Age of bike (newer = more expensive)
6. Price of bike
7. Bike category/engine size/model
8. Commuting/no commuting
9. Bonus riding qualifications
10. Expected mileage
11. Pillion cover
12. Rider occupation
13. If insuring for theft, which security devices you have installed

Unfortunately, as you may have noticed, this list is also ranked more
or less from least changeable to most changeable. You will not be able
to adjust your no-claims bonus, location or age when starting.

I found that random combinations of things would affect the price in
drastic ways. For example, pillion cover and theft insurance ended up
being only a marginal amount more for the bike I ended up getting, but
could cost multiple thousands on other plans. My advice is to throw as
many quotes as you can at the wall and see what sticks.

## Security

As a rider in London, security on your bike is essential. In this part
of the country, motorcycle theft statistics are terrifying. I never
leave my bike unlocked anywhere and have taken multiple steps to
ensure my home lockup is as secure as it can be. I consider the
initial setup costs well worth the effort in what they will save me in
peace of mind, insurance and potential thefts.

As a base setup, I'd recommend a minimum of a chunky chain and lock at
home. From there, a chain and disk lock for on-the-go, and a GPS
tracker are your next best investments. Of course, if you can keep
your bike off the road in any way, that's also a huge advantage.

Now, for some specific gear recommendations. For additional
information, I'd recommend checking out Bennet's guides and videos.

### Chains

I got my security chains from Pragmasis, and could honestly not
recommend even considering any other options. These chains are solid,
pass the highest security ratings, and the service I received from the
team was exceptional.

The main choice you'll have is which chains to go for. I opted for a
1.2m/13mm chain for on-the-go and a 22mm beast for at-home. Although
the 13mm is a little heavy, it's still manageable in a backpack, aided
by the clever noose design that helps keep the chain short. Crucially,
13mm is the smallest you can go while still being resistant to most
bolt cutters (thieves will still be able to get at your bike with an
angle grinder if they're determined). Save for someone attacking with
multiple angle grinder disks, the 22m chain is basically unstoppable.

If you don't have a solid fixture to put your chain around, you'll
also likely need a ground anchor. I also got one from Pragmasis which
I'd highly recommend. Make sure whatever anchor you get fits the size
of your chain!

### Locks

If you're getting one of the Pragmasis chains, I'd also recommend
their clever Roundlock. This fits tightly into the chains, making it
tough for a thief to get at. They're reasonably priced and can be
keyed-alike so you can unlock multiple locks with the same key.

I also have a Pragmasis D-lock. This is a well-rated lock, and it's
nice that I can share the same key with the Roundlocks. However, if I
were buying again today, I'd probably splurge and get the Litelok X1
or X3. These locks have incredible resistance to angle grinders which
is a big deal in London.

### GPS Trackers

When running the numbers, a GPS tracker is one of the best security
investments you can make. BikeTrac, one leading brand, promises a 94%
recovery rate. After spreading the ~£300 cost over a few years and
taking into account the cost of your bike and London theft rates, this
is almost certainly a positive return on investment. You can also
transfer the tracker to a new bike should you sell your current one.

Note that you will need a monthly subscription for many trackers.
Although this is an additional expense, it does cover 24-hour tracker
monitoring and will mean you can send out a recovery service should
your bike ever go missing and police are unable to get there.

Unfortunately, a tracker is invisible, so won't act as a deterrent to
thieves. I've also heard of people's bikes getting stolen and
recovered, but being badly messed up in the process. Best to combine
it with chains and other devices.

### DataTag

DataTag is a set of security markings that go on your bike to make the
parts easier to track and thus harder to sell on the black market.

You'll get a set of stickers to warn off thieves and a kit to make all
your bike's parts identifiable. Your unique markings will get put in a
database and ensure that any parts that show up will get linked back
to you.

## Gear

What gear you need will be determined by what kind of riding you're
doing, your budget, and your risk tolerance.

A helmet is the only protection legally required on a bike.
Additionally, you'll need solid boots, gloves and a jacket, at a
minimum. I often see people going around London without these items
which I consider insane. Falling off at even 20mph without this basic
protection is going to mess you up. With it, you'll be fine.

If you're riding faster, outside of London, or want to be safer,
you'll want some kind of protective trousers and an armoured jacket.
Even in slower London traffic, this is probably a good idea.

### Helmet

The main thing I'd look out for on a helmet is fit. Maybe I have a
weirdly shaped head, but was surprised by how much this mattered.
Seriously, try on your helmet in person before you commit to buying
anything.

Other than fit, which helmet you get is mostly going to be determined
by aesthetic preferences and which kind of riding you're doing. If you
have a racier bike, a racier helmet will make sense so that your
viewing angle matches your riding position and speed. If you're riding
a trial bike, something with an open face and goggles might be more
your thing.

Some other things you might want to look out for:

- Sun visor
- Ability to clip in Bluetooth headsets
- Locking mechanisms (D-ring is best)
- Weight

### Gloves

Gloves were my most straightforward piece of gear to buy. My only word
of caution would be that things get colder on a bike than you think.
Wind chill really is a factor. Even if you have heated grips to warm
your palms, the top of your hands will get cold. If you're riding on
colder days, you'll need winter gloves.

### Jacket/Armour

Finding a good jacket is achievable with a bit of common sense. Pick
something with a good protective rating (CE level A as a minimum; AAA
is the gold standard) that you like the style of, and you're good.

For some reason, I found motorcycle jackets to come up very small. As
someone who usually wears large clothing, I found the jackets that fit
best were XL or XXL.

There are lots of good used finds on eBay for £50-100. You'll also be
able to find some cooler pieces with a bit of wear on them. Although
judging sizing will be a pain, I'd recommend setting some search
alerts for your size and seeing what comes up.

Another option is to not buy a new jacket and instead protect yourself
with strap-on armour. These items will fit under any jacket and give
you some added protection. Note that armour will protect you from
impacts, but not from abrasion. A jacket is still going to be the
safest option.

### Trousers

Good riding jeans are relatively easy to come by. These will look more
or less like a normal pair of jeans, with the addition of protective
armour and abrasion-resistant denim. I've gotten by with just riding
jeans so far, although the lack of wind resistance in the winter makes
me sometimes regret it.

If you want to go one step further, you can get leather or textile
protective trousers that will offer a bit more protection.

I've also got a set of pull-over waterproofs for when I get caught in
a rainstorm.

### Boots

Although I've survived so far on just a pair of sturdy non-motorcycle
boots, real motorcycle boots will provide you with a few extra
advantages you may want to consider.

First, they'll be extra crash-resistant. This is both because
motorcycle boots are more solidly constructed, and because they tend
to come up higher on the leg.

Second, motorcycle boots are lace-free, meaning you don't have to
worry about your laces getting caught in anything.

Finally, motorcycle boots will provide the most ergonomic fit for
changing gears and braking. They're designed to be both solid and
suitable for the control you need on your bike.

## Maintenance

One thing I did not fully factor into getting a motorcycle was the
maintenance. Compared to cars, motorcycles need a lot more
maintenance. They're more exposed to the elements and need to be tuned
more often. Fortunately, motorcycles are a lot more intelligible than
cars and they're easier to fix.

Your base motorcycle maintenance routine is going to be the following:

- Keep your bike clean (free!)
- Chain - Every 300-500 miles, clean and lube your chain. You'll need
  cleaning supplies and a rear stand to do this (~£50). Video guide
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgPpLKCUlbA).
- Oil changes - Every few thousand miles (or whatever your service
  manual tells you) replace the oil in your bike. ~£20.
- Service - Following the service intervals in your manual, take your
  bike for a full service at a shop (or do it yourself). £200-£400
  depending on the size of the service.
- New tyres - Motorcycles need new tyres approximately every 10,000
  miles (or less if you ride aggressively). ~£350 a new set.
- Battery - Motorcycle batteries run out a lot faster than car
  batteries. If you leave the battery in the cold and don't ride your
  bike, it will drain and you will need to recharge it or replace it
  completely (~£80). Buy a trickle charger for winter (~£35). A GPS
  tracker will also help warn you about low battery levels.
- MOT - £30. Once a year for bikes over three years old. Hopefully, a
  straightforward pass if you follow all of the above.

## Navigation

Surprisingly, I've found AirPods are the best way to do navigation on
a bike. Note that this method fails on longer trips when battery
becomes an issue.

I hear people talk about quad-locks for their phones which seems a
cost-effective option. I like the distraction-free ride and wouldn't
want the chance of notifications showing up while I ride.

A full GPS device is another option, especially if you're doing longer
trips. My friend has a minimal Beeline Moto which seems cool.

A note specifically for London: your sense of direction WILL fail you.
Even if you know where you are, following your sense of direction will
not help you. London's one-way systems are a nightmare, and navigating
on a motorcycle is a whole new game compared to navigating on a
bicycle or on foot.

## Assorted tips

Buy earplugs, especially if you have a loud exhaust. An hour-long ride
on my bike is enough to leave my ears ringing.

While we're talking about exhausts, my advice is to not buy one. Your
money is almost certainly going to be better spent on other things:
gear, maintenance, insurance, courses, a new bike. As fun as it is,
you'll also piss everyone off. I bought my bike used with a loud
exhaust and I feel guilty riding around. Noise cameras also operate in
certain parts of the UK and can fine you.

## How to ride safely and fast

If you successfully pass your test, you will be more than competent
enough to ride on roads safely (at least in the UK where we have
stringent test standards). That said, motorcycle skill progression is
an infinite game where you will always have room to improve.

Some initial tips for riding fast and safe:

1. Go to a car park and practice your slow speed manoeuvres e.g.
   figure of 8s, tight slaloms, rear braking (MotoJitsu app is good
   for helping here).
2. Stick within your limits. Specifically, always ensure your stopping
   distance is within your line of sight
3. Look ahead and plan more than you think you need to. You'll see and
   handle hazards sooner.
4. Practice your braking on quiet roads. The quicker you can brake,
   the faster you can go.
5. Lifesavers (glancing over your shoulder before turning) will save
   your life. Do not forget these.
6. Technical control is what I thought about initially. In practice,
   road positioning, attitude and awareness are bigger factors in
   safety.

## Joining the cult: the felt experience of being a motorcyclist

One thing I did not anticipate when learning to ride a bike was the
shift in how others perceived me. I now find myself a member of a new
cult.

My social world has changed. I've learned the complex rules of who and
who not to nod at (no scooters, no L plates, no cruisers, no
commuters). Men have begun to treat me with a touch more respect.
Little boys now light up with excitement and beg me to rev my engine.
Some girls find it attractive, others see you as a reckless teenager.
I know the taste of a bacon sandwich at a greasy biker's café.

The shape of the world has changed around me. It's both bigger and
smaller. Suddenly, the Alps don't seem that far away. I have a new
skill, a new hobby. I have the freedom to go where I want.
