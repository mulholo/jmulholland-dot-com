Although <Link to="/speed">I believe speed to be under-rated
globally</Link>, there are exceptions to the rule of 'more speed
better'.

- Sometimes more effort has such minimal returns that speed increases
  are not worth it. More effort will only burn you out.
  [See Derek Sivers' story of the bike ride](https://sive.rs/relax)
  for a great example of this:

  > push-push-push I had been doing had given me only a 4 percent
  > boost. I could just take it easy and get 96 percent of the
  > results.

- Some improvements require period of integration or recovery that
  cannot be accelerated. For example, lifting weights 10x a week does
  not necessarily increase your strength more than training 3x a week;
  your body needs to recover. Likewise, skill development may need
  periods of reflection before advice can be internalised and acted
  upon.
- Speed is useless if you're going in the wrong direction. Aim for the
  vector, velocity, not speed. Focusing on speed can crowd out your
  direction finding ability and encourage you to head in the wrong
  direction.
