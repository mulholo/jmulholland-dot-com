*Various tips to make your iPhone distraction-free*

- Use [Channel](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1464464213) to remove distracting parts of websites e.g. the YouTube home page. I now have Twitter with only notifications, DMs and search, YouTube with only saved later and subscriptions, and Instagram with DMs only. I have been looking for this functionality for years and Channel solved it effortlessly.
- Use an ad blocker. I like AdLock as it also lets you view YouTube videos ad-free and even play them in the background (essentaly, YouTube premium for a fraction of the cost).
- Set your iPhone to black and white by using a colour filter accessibility shortcut. It's incredible how much calmer this makes using your phone.
- Reduce screen brightness below the supposed minimum using a zoom accessibility filter. Useful for using your phone at night without blinding yourself.
- Use native or third-parrty screen time apps (e.g. [Opal](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/opal-screen-time-control/id1497465230)) to block phone usage completely.
