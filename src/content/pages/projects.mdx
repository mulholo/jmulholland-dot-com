impact I can make for our language-learning users.

## Education

### Philosophy, University of Bristol

##### 2015 → 2018

I studied philosophy from 2015 to 2018 at Bristol. I specialised in
the analytical end of the philosophy spectrum with a focus on topics
such as the philosophy of science, decision-theory, probability,
philosophy of maths and logic. I continue my interest to the present
and still love a good philosophy book.
