## Jobs

### Memrise

##### May 2019 → Present

I am a software engineer at [Memrise](https://memrise.com/), the
world's most entertaining language learning app. At Memrise, I'm
currently driving forward our transition from a monolithic Django
app to a more modern REST API/Next.js stack. I deliver high-quality
features to a user base of hundreds of thousands and love seeing the
impact I can make for our language-learning users.

### PeopleGoal

##### June 2018 → April 2019

My first engineering role was as a front-end engineer at
[PeopleGoal](https://peoplegoal.com). I was responsible for building
and designing features for a data-focused, enterprise React/React
application and lead the construction of a new and performant content
site, built on Next.js.

## Side Projects

## Education

### Philosophy, University of Bristol

##### 2015 → 2018

I studied philosophy from 2015 to 2018 at Bristol. I specialised in
the analytical end of the philosophy spectrum with a focus on topics
such as the philosophy of science, decision-theory, probability,
philosophy of maths and logic. I continue my interest to the present
and still love a good philosophy book.
