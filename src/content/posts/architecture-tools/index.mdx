I think tooling is a neglected part of good software architecture.
Although thoughtful design, proactive communication and constant
learning are all essential, tooling can be a powerful complement to
these approaches.

Tooling streamlines back-and-forth discussion, instead providing
instant, automated feedback. Much like testing, it produces a
self-documenting codebase that is easier for developers to understand.
Finally, enforcing consistent structure and boundaries in CI makes a
codebase more maintainable and less susceptible to the 'pattern drift'
that is so common in larger and older codebases.

Roughly from least to most complicated, here are six ways to enforce
better architecture in your JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

## 1. Public and Private Properties

Although JavaScript is not strongly typed and has no concept of
external/private properties, it is possible to provide implicit hints
about which functions and values are private. The most common way of
doing this is with an underscore prefix.

```javascript
export class SomeClass() {
  _privateMethod() {/* ... */}
  publicMethod() {/* ... */}
}

export const _privateFn = () => // ...
export const publicFn = () => // ...
```

Of course, without static analysis to assist here, this is merely a
hint to developers not to use the underscore-marked values.

However, if you're working in TypeScript you can use a compiler to
leverage the
[built-in support](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html#public-private-and-protected-modifiers)
for `public` and `private` class members.[^1] Marking a field or a
method on a class as `private` means that that it won't be accessible
when that class is used i.e. `private` methods can only be called
inside that particularly class. This is an effective way of cleaning
up your API boundaries. However, this approach is also fairly limited
as it only applies to classes. It should also be noted that, even if
your library is written in TypeScript, any JavaScript calling the
library will still have access to the private properties.

## 2. Linting with [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import)

[`eslint-plugin-import`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import)
is an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin that runs static analysis
on your code to check for import related errors, style guide conflicts
and architectural issues. For the purposes of this post, we'll only
focus on the architectural side of things, but the plugin is well
worth adopting for its other features too. There are three
architecture rules in the plugin:
[`no-internal-modules`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-internal-modules.md),
[`no-cycle`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-cycle.md),
and
[`no-relative-parent-imports`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-relative-parent-imports.md).
I'll go through each one in turn.

### `no-internal-modules`

`no-internal-modules` bans imports from submodules of other modules.
In other words, it forces you to use
[the barrel pattern](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel)
everywhere.

```javascript
import Dropdown from 'src/components/Dropdown' // error
import { Dropdown } from 'src/components' // ok
```

Enforcing `index` file exports can be useful as it forces you to
explicitly decide upon your boundaries. For example, our `Dropdown`
component might have related filtering and sorting functions that are
only meant to be used internally. `no-internal-modules`, plus an
additional export layer, can help shield these internal functions from
leaking out into the rest of your project.

### `no-cycle`

A circular dependency occurs when module A depends on module B and
module B depends on module A (even if this occurs indirectly).
`no-cycle` will warn you of any such dependencies in your JavaScript
project.

Circular dependencies do not throw in JavaScript but they will
sometimes cause
[`undefined` errors](https://youtu.be/JQQX62cUaYw?t=117) to appear.
They are also a sign of spaghetti code. If modules are looped
together, refactors that attempt to modify this tangled structure are
going to run into difficulties when pulling on one thread ends up
bringing a whole section of the codebase with it.

In practice, I had a hard time making sense of the output from the
`no-cycle` rule. It often had to be traced through several files,
line-by-line. In my mind, cyclical dependencies are more naturally
represented by graphs than sequential linting errors. `no-cycle` is
better than nothing, but I think there are superior alternatives for
dealing with cyclical dependencies (we'll come to `dependency-curiser`
soon enough).

### `no-relative-parent-imports`

`no-relative-parent-imports` bans any imports containing a `..` i.e.
you can only import from siblings or modules.

```javascript
import foo from '../foo' // error
import bar from './bar' // ok
import baz from 'baz' // ok
```

This is quite a forceful rule that makes it very clear where each file
goes. It encourages a clean, tree-like structure, as opposed to a
complex, graph-like one.

Especially if you are introducing this to a pre-existing project, this
rule may be a lot of work to incorporate. You'll need to refactor to
use dependency injection, add new modules or restructure your
filesystem. One compromise may be to add it to your `eslintrc` as a
warning rather than an error and let it slowly shape your structure
over time.

Even if it initially exposed a number of conflicts with the way my
code was, I found this rule incredibly helpful for noticing messy
structure in my code and I'd recommend you give it a go, even if it is
only as a learning experience.

## 3. Project References

[Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) are
a feature of the TypeScript compiler that allow effective splitting of
your project into submodules. In short, references require you to
explicitly enumerate which imports are allowed and will throw compiler
errors if you try to violate these constraints.

To add a new submodule with references, add the path to the
[`references`](https://www.staging-typescript.org/tsconfig#references)
property in `tsconfig.json`.

```json
"references": [
  { "path": "./src/myLib" }
]
```

Then, in the submodule (`./src/myLib` in this case), add a new
`tsconfig.json`, extending the base tsconfig and with the following
properties:

```json
"extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
"include": ["**/*.ts"],
"compilerOptions": {
  "noEmit": false,
  "composite": true,
  "declaration": true,
  "declarationMap": true
}
```

- `noEmit`: tell the compiler to output `.js` and `.map` files from
  build
- `composite`: allow `tsc` to determine whether the folder has been
  built yet
- `declaration`: output a `.d.ts` file
- `declarationMaps`: output source maps

Finally, run `yarn tsc --build`. This will build the submodule for use
across the project and throw an error if one submodule tries to import
from another non-referenced submodule.

Being explicit about dependencies like this is a powerful tool.
References encourage dependency injection over globals, better folder
structure, more modular code and generally slow the process of your
codebase turning into a
[big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/).

Additionally, using project references will allow you to break up the
compilation of your project into discrete chunks, speeding up compile
times and IDE performance.

The one big limitation of references is that they only work with
Microsoft's `tsc` compiler and not with `babel-preset-typescript` (for
now at least). This means that if you're using babel to compile your
TypeScript, or use a framework like Next.js or `create-react-app` that
does so under the hood, you're going to struggle to incorporate this
feature into your codebase.

## 4. Dependency Cruiser

[`depdency-cruiser`](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/tree/develop/doc) is
a tool to enforce rules about dependencies. Think of it as a testing
library for dependencies and structure, instead of code behaviour.

I found dependency-cruiser to strike an excellent balance between ease
of use and impact. The `--init` command was very easy to get going
with and caught some small issues in my codebase right away.

`dependency-cruiser` has a lot of overlap with the goals of
`eslint-plugin-import`. Like the ESLint plugin, it will identify both
dependency errors (e.g. correct placement of packages inside
`devDependencies`/`dependencies`, identifying missing packages,
deprecation warnings), and architecture rules (e.g. restricting
imports, no circular dependencies).

However, `dependency-cruiser` works as an independent tool, not an
ESLint plugin. This means it is a more powerful and flexible way of
accomplishing architecture goals. For example, `dependency-cruiser`
allows you to
[write your own rules](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/blob/develop/doc/rules-tutorial.md)
to define which imports are restricted. This is an incredibly powerful
tool for architecture refactors and essentially gives you TDD for
architecture.

Let's say you have a cookie package that provides a small, usable
wrapper around the browser cookie APIs. This dependency should have no
dependencies to avoid tangling the domain specific code in the rest of
your app with this isolated library. With `dependency-cruiser`, we can
define a rule to enforce that our cookie library is a leaf node with
no dependencies.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  forbidden: [
    {
      name: 'cookies-leaf',
      severity: 'error',
      comment:
        'cookies library should be a leaf node with no dependencies'
      from: {
        path: './src/lib/cookies',
        pathNot: '\\.test\\.ts$',
      },
      to: {}, // all imports
    },
  ]
}
```

Now, if we try and import an external dependency we'll get an error.

```javascrtipt
// src/cookie/index.ts
import bannedImport from '../some/bannedImport';
```

```bash
error cookies-leaf: src/cookies/index.ts → src/some/bannedImport.ts
```

Graphing is another area where `dependency-cruiser`'s
architecture-first approach shines. Dependency graphs can be generated
for your project to give you a high-level overview of what to focus on
and highlight any circular dependencies in your codebase.

## 5. Yarn Workspaces and Lerna

All the approaches so far are applicable to defining boundaries within
a single package. However, if your project grows you may want to turn
your one big bundle into a multi-package monorepo. Although it does
come with additional overhead, this approach is a powerful way to
separate boundaries and crystallise clean structure.

There are two tools in the JavaScript ecosystem to help you manage
multiple packages in a monorepo:
[Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) and
[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).

Yarn Workspaces is the simplest of the two approaches.[^2] Its main
job is to ensure that the dependencies for each of your separate
sub-packages are synchronised and optimised. However, Yarn Workspaces
by themselves do make synchronisation over the various sub-modules
difficult.

This is where the next tool, Lerna, comes in. Lerna provides extra
power to coordinate packages across monorepos. For example, the
`lerna run` command provides a way to run scripts from multiple
`package.json`s at once. Lerna can also synchronise package publishing
and automate changelogs, ensuring that all dependencies of your
project can easily adapt to API changes and refactor accordingly.

## 6. Hosted Packages

The next step would be to completely separate packages into separate
repos and host them on a tool such as [NPM](http://npmjs.com/) or
[GitHub packages](https://github.com/features/packages). If you're
sharing your code with multiple end users, this is a great way to
scale your project.

However, this being the last item on the list, the work here is much
more involved. As well as the work you'll need to do to setup all
those regular first-time project things (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript,
Babel, Husky, ...), you'll also have to manage NPM publishing and
library-first building (probably with
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/)).

While the extra friction you add from having an independent repo can
be great for cleanly separating boundaries and enforcing structure, it
does mean that changes are also harder to make. Use this approach with
caution and only apply it when absolutely necessary.

## Conclusion

Of course, many of the approaches here can be combined. You could
potentially use all of them together across a large enough
application. I'm also looking forwards to the landscape evolving as
more and more of this architecture work starts to get automated
([Destiny](https://github.com/benawad/destiny), in particular, is
something I'm keeping my eye on). If there's a favourite tool of yours
that you're excited about, email me or

    There is also a JavaScript proposal for `#` prefixes to make class
    members as private which is also supported in the TypeScript. See
