title: 'The Small Group'

My recent research rabbit hole has been investigating what I would
like to term the Small Group.

Lying somewhere between a club and a loosely defined set of friends,
the Small Group is a repeated theme in the lives of the successful.
Benjamin Franklin had the
[Junto Club](http://www.benjamin-franklin-history.org/junto-club/),
Tolkein and C.S. Lewis had
[The Inklings](https://www.ignatius.com/promotions/looking-for-the-king/who-were-the-inklings.htm),
Jobs and Wozniak had
[Homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club).
[The Bloomsbury Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group)
was integral to the success of Virginia Woolf, Clive Bell, and John
Maynard Keynes, while
[MIT’s Model Railroad Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club)
spawned much of modern hacker culture.

The Small Group offers a private, close-knit environment in which
members can share ideas freely. For Bloomsbury, this meant challenging
norms on feminism, pacifism, sexuality and art. For the members of
Homebrew and MIT’s model railway club, this was merely the experience
of being your nerdy self amongst other like-minded nerds.

Twelve appears to be a magic number of members for the Small Group.
Although
[The Cambridge Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles)
(so named because, like Jesus’ followers, there were twelve of them)
were one of the few groups that stuck _explicitly_ to this number, The
Junto Club, The Inklings and The Bloomsbury Group all had
approximately twelve core members.[^1]

Around a dozen members is the sweet spot of social motivation: small
enough to know everyone, yet large enough that the group won’t
collapse if one or two members’ enthusiasm wanes; small enough that
you are not daunted by competing with the whole world, yet large
enough that you still need to be on your toes to keep up.

It is common for Small Groups to further enhance their motivational
effects through clearly defined structures. Weekly meetings at the
Junto Club, with a rota ensuring all members would give a talk, kept
the intellectual bar at a certain level. Bloomsbury, meanwhile, split
into a Thursday thinking group for writers, and a Friday idea and
exhibition organisation group for artists.

However, structure is by no means a necessity. Amongst
technology-based groups in particular, there is a general dislike of
anything too organised. Hackers do not like being told what to do. For
example, the hacker group w00w00, whose membership contained the
founders of both Napster and WhatsApp, stated
[on its homepage](http://www.w00w00.org/) that “there are no
“members”” while Homebrew met raggedly in carparks to trade parts.

In place of structure, these groups organised around ability and
commitment. w00w00 allowed new participants in if they had an invite
from a pre-existing member or could independently show sufficient
technical acumen. The Tech Model Railroad Club allowed free access to
the train room, so long as you had proved your engagement by
clocking-in 40 hours of work on the system.

The assistance members can give one another isn’t purely motivational,
however. In-person communication is high-bandwidth and offers feedback
that is difficult to replicate elsewhere. An ongoing relationship
provides more effective advice, allowing the use of shorthand for
concepts and a two-way conversation that autodidactic education lacks.

Reading about how good these groups can be has made me envious. I want
one too. What does realising that want look like? What is the Small
Group for the 2020s?

I know that there are many people out there who are excited about
working on interesting projects, discovering new things and exploring
the space of what is possible. Indeed, I’ve seen several other
promising efforts in this area.
[Anna Gat](https://twitter.com/TheAnnaGat) is doing a great job at
building a large, swirling, international community with
[The Interintellect](https://www.interintellect.com/).
[The recreation of the public salon](https://www.publicspheresalons.com/)
is another intriguing attempt at solving this problem. I’m also a
member of newly-created bookclubs, Slack groups, and Telegram chats
full of people looking to get to know one other, be inspired and stay
motivated.

But these examples aren’t quite what I’m aiming for. I want something
smaller, more intimate, more regular. Not meeting someone you like and
only managing to run into them once every three months, but creating
regular, meaningful connections.

While I enjoy meeting people at one-off or quarterly events, these
interactions don’t compound in a way that a more regular relationship
with someone can. A single conversation may lead you down an
interesting path, but a community keeps you on it.

The other flaw of many modern attempts at providing a community is
that such attempts are often online-only, or at least online-first.
Although online connections are a great thing to have in your life—I
am writing this post during a global pandemic lockdown which would be
far harder to survive with only IRL connections—there is something
sorely missing when you don’t get to see someone’s face. As well as
the body-language cues that make up so much of human interaction,
online communities miss out on several other advantages.

First, they shift the emphasis towards consumption, not creation. How
many tweets do you write versus how many do you read, for example?
Communicating in real-life shifts the ratio of creation to consumption
far closer to 1:1, thus forcing you to fully develop your ideas.

Online communities also don’t self-correct in the same way. A fixed
time and place ensure that you will be missed if you don’t turn up.
Dropping your commitments becomes harder by default. The omnipresent
communication streams that dominate online life are far easier to
opt-out of whereas if you drop out of a small, physical group you will
be missed.

We are now at a place where we can define the Small Group a little
more clearly. Some things are specific and easily mapped from
historical examples. The small group size of about a dozen people
seems to translate well, for example. Other attributes are harder to
pin down. Like the examples I have mentioned, the modern Small Group
should have a strong sense of fun and playfulness.[^2]

The Small Group must strike a delicate balance between indirection and
real progress. Pure business drive is not desirable. The goal here is
not to invest more in the skills you use at work. Instead, it is to be
truly exploratory for no immediate purpose. It is to waste time (yet
to savour it), to wander off in the wrong direction (and to find an
exciting new path). Indirection and exploration should not come at the
cost of doing and building. Doing and building should not come at the
cost of having fun.

What about subject matter? Historical Small Groups are a mixture of
the specific (model railways, building personal computers, writing
fantasy fiction) and the eclectic (art, culture, philosophy, general
self-improvement). In a sense, I do not think it matters, and the
potential landscape is broad.

From a purely personal perspective, however, I do not (yet) have any
one thing that takes priority over my other interests. Therefore, my
selfish bias is to create something under some kind of umbrella niche
that is not too specific.

In summary, the format I can conceive of that seems most likely to
succeed is along the lines of the following.

- Unofficial membership status of around a dozen members.
- Each member works on personal or collaborative projects and is held
  accountable through a combination of regular talks and
  presentations.
- Members are unconstrained in what their project topics are, but they
  would fall roughly under the domain of ‘explorative technology’.
  Members are probably interested in some subset of
  [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/), doing
  [weird stuff with GANs](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1067944124328763392?s=20),
  interesting data visualisations,
  [Tools for Thought](http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/) and
  [Second Brains](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/),
  [tech-related art projects](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/privacy-campaigners-dazzle-camouflage-met-police-surveillance),
  [reconceptualising programming](https://divan.dev/posts/visual_programming_go/),
  writing explorative essays, hardware experiments, and things that
  cannot be put in a list such as this.
- Physical meeting space(s) that promote collaboration, spontaneity
  and deep work. A combination of members’ houses, libraries, coffee
  shops and co-working spaces may feel these needs.

Maybe this is all a symptom of me not quite yet managing the swirling,
messy communities that do and should make up a modern city. But I’m
not sure. I think I do want a Small Group.

I’d like this essay to be a form of action, not a pipe dream. So, if
you are in London and into the themes I’ve talked about here, then put
your email down below or
[email me directly](mailto:james@jmulholland.com) and we shall see
where it goes.

  Homebrew is the only real outlier I looked into, without about 750
  members over the course of a year (although still small enough in
  practice to meet in members’ garages).

  Relatedly, I think a clear aesthetic that conveys the group’s ethos
  would also be desirable. I’m keeping track of thoughts on
  [this mood board](https://www.are.na/james-mulholland/the-small-group)and
  urge you to add imagery if you think of anything that would fit.
