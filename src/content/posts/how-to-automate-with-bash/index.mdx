As a software engineer, I love automating things (or, rather, hate
repeating things). One of the best ways you can save yourself some
precious development time is by learning Bash. I’ve had a great ROI on
learning the basics of Bash, so I wanted to share the 80% of stuff you
need to get going and start making meaningful improvements to your
development productivity.

## Intro to Bash

If you're comfortable with what bash is, you can skip this section. If
not, read on.

Bash is the language and prompt that you use when interacting with the
Linux/macOS command line. If you've ever typed `cd` or `mkdir`, that's
Bash.

From the command line, Bash is an interface to pretty much anything
within your computer. You can access, move, and edit files; you can
run and kill a series of commands; you can grab information about your
system. When you realise that a command prompt used to be the only way
people used to interact with computers, you'll realise how powerful
Bash can be.

Although you'll most commonly interact with Bash through the command
prompt, Bash's real power comes in when you start writing scripts. If
you repeatedly do anything through the command line, it might be worth
investigating whether you can express that activity with a Bash
script.

Want to automatically update your local database with up to data from
production, keep two files in sync or bundle multiple DevOps commands
into one? All easy with Bash.

So now that we know what Bash is, let’s see how we can use it.

## Bash In the command line

There’s loads you can do with Bash (check out
[this cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/bash) for a sample) but we’ll
stick to the basics here. My goal here is to make you productive with
the minimal effort, then let you go from there.

### File and Directory Manipulation

A lot of what you’ll be doing in Bash is manipulating your filesystem.
Before we start manipulating, however, let’s deal with navigation so
we know where we are and how to get where we want to go. `pwd` Prints
the Working Directory, that is, it tells us which repository we are
in. You might also have the current directory shown to you in the
command prompt.

![command-line-pwd](command-line-pwd.png 'My command line, showing the current working directory as `~/proj`')

If you want to change directory, `cd my-project` will take you to the
folder called `my-project`. If you’re unsure of what folders you can
navigate to from the working directory are, type `ls` to list all the
files and directories in the current directory. If you want to see
hidden files too, type `ls -a`. The `-a` is an example of an option
which you can pass to commands which allow you to modify their
behaviour. You can also list within nested directories with
`ls -a some/nested/path`.

Now we know where we are, let’s create a new file. `touch foo.txt`
will create a text file named ‘foo’ in the current working directory.
`mkdir my-repo-name` does the same thing but for repositories. If you
want to make nested repositories, you’ll need `mkdir -p my-repo-name`.

Once you’ve created a file, you can copy it to a new location with
`cp file new/file/location/`. If you want to move it, it’s the same
thing but with `mv` instead of `cp`. `mv` is also used to rename files
(what’s the difference between moving `old-name.txt` to `new-name.txt`
and renaming `old-name.txt` to `new-name.txt` ?)

Finally, you can delete files with `rm file.txt`. If you need to
recursively delete a repo and all the files within it, use
`rm -r folder-name`.

### Directing Output and Passing Data Around

You don’t want to just move files and edit their names, however, you
also want to be able to edit their contents. Let’s create a new file,
but this time, populate it with some text.

```bash
$ echo "node_modules" > .gitignore
```

`echo` outputs some text to the console. Rather than simply print
“node*modules”, however, we can \_redirect* the output to a file
called `.gitignore` using `>`. `>` tells the prompt to take the output
of the left hand side and put it in the contents of the file on the
right hand side.

We can read the contents of `.gitignore` to check this has worked
using `cat`. You should see the contents of `.gitignore` appear in
your command line:

```bash
$ cat .gitignore
node_modules
```

`>` is limited in that it can only add/replace the entire contents of
a file. If you want to _append_ something to a file you need `>>`. For
example, let’s say you later remember you want to ignore not only
`node_modules`, but also your built code, found in the `dist`
directory. Adding `dist` to `.gitignore` is as easy as
`echo "dist" >> .gitignore`.

One of the most useful things to know in Bash is the pipe command
(`|`). Whereas `>` and `>>` redirect command outputs into files, `|`
redirects output into other commands. This is super-useful when you
need chain together multiple commands into one.

`grep` is a useful command line tool for searching through text and
we’ll use to demonstrate the pipe command. When you pass in some data
to `grep`, it can search through it for a given set of
characters/pattern. Let’s say we’ve forgotten whether we added
`node_modules` to our `.gitignore` earlier. We can search the
`.gitignore` file for ‘node_modules’ using `grep` and it will print
any lines in the searched file which contain a match.

```bash
$ grep node_modules .gitignore
.gitignore
```

We can rewrite this to use two commands, threaded together with a
pipe:

```bash
$ cat .gitignore | grep node_modules
```

This command tells Bash to take the output of `.gitignore` and pass it
as an argument to the `grep` search for ‘node_modules’. If you've ever
used a `.then(callback)` in JavaScript, it's a little bit like that.

Although it doesn’t necessarily make sense to use a pipe in this
instance, `|` can be incredibly useful when you have more dynamic data
being passed around, or longer chains going on.

One last command to know before we move onto writing a Bash script is
`&&`. `&&` is super-easy to grok: all it does is run one command after
another.

```bash
$ echo "hello" && echo "world"
hello
world
```

## Creating a Bash Script

Now we’ve got the basics mastered, time to write a script. We’re going
to be making a script that sets up a new web project folder, including
creating some basic files, initialising git and initialising yarn.

### Creating a basic Bash Script

Let’s start by creating a new `.sh` (Bash) file.

```bash
touch new-proj.sh
```

Open up the newly created file (e.g. if you like to use VSCode, type
`code new-proj.sh`) and then type in the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Making a new project"
```

`#!/bin/bash` tells the computer that this is a Bash file and that you
can run it even if it doesn’t end in `.sh` (we’ll get to that later).

Save your file. You’ve created your first Bash script!

Let’s run it. To do this, all we need to do is type `./new-proj.sh`
(`./` stands for the current directory).

```bash
$ ./new-proj.sh
permission denied: ./new-proj.sh
```

Oh no! Error! The permissions when you create a new Bash script are a
little weird. To allow your account to run the script, we need to
modify these permissions. Do that with the following command:

```bash
$ chmod u+x new-proj.sh
```

And try again:

```bash
$ ./new-proj.sh
Making a new project
```

Wonderful.

Of course, we want to be able to do a little more than just print a
statement. Time to add some more useful functionality. I’ll put in
some comments to stub out what we’ll be doing in our script. In Bash,
comments start with `#`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Making a new project"
# make a new folder
# make index.js, index.html and style.css files
# initialise git
# initialise yarn
```

Making a new folder is easy; we learnt how to do it with the `mkdir`
command earlier. But what do we call the folder we want to make?
Presumably you don’t want every project you make to have the same
folder name.

This is where we can introduce parameters. The parameters to a bash
script can be accessed in the order they were passed in using `$1`,
`$2`, …, `$n` where n is the position of the argument that was passed
in. So, if we want to call `./new-proj.sh my-proj` to create a folder
called `my proj`, we’ll need to add the following to the script:

```bash
# ...
# make a new folder with the name of the first param
mkdir $1
# ...
```

Running the script will now make a directory for us with the specified
name.

```bash
$ ./new-proj.sh testRepo
```

What if we want to reuse this variable? Wouldn’t it be nice to have it
named at the top of the file so we don’t have to wonder what `$1`
means?

```bash
DIRNAME=$1
```

The above line will create a variable named `DIRNAME` which we can
then access throughout the rest of the script with `$DIRNAME`. Much
more readable.

```bash
DIRNAME=$1
echo "Making repo named $DIRNAME"
mkdir $DIRNAME
```

Now we can make some files…

```bash
# make index.js, index.html and style.css files
touch $DIRNAME/index.html
touch $DIRNAME/style.css
touch $DIRNAME/index.js
```

…and initialise git, including adding a `.gitignore file`…

```bash
# initialise git
git init $DIRNAME
echo "node_modules" > $DIRNAME/.gitignore
echo "dist" >> $DIRNAME/.gitignore
```

…and jump into the new directory to initialise yarn.

```bash
# initiaise yarn, answering 'yes' to all Qs
cd $DIRNAME
yarn init --quiet --yes
```

Great, you have a new project folder set up for you at just a few
characters’ notice.

### Adding Options

Not all projects are the same, however. What if we don’t always want
JavaScript or Git in the project? This is where options come in.

This section gets a little bit more fiddly than above as Bash’s syntax
isn’t always the most readable, but I’ll explain everything as clearly
as possible so that there’s no magic going on.

The first thing we need to do is set some variables according to
whether certain flags are passed. i.e. `./new-proj.sh -j -g newProj`
will set `$JS` and `$GIT` to true, whereas `./new-proj.sh. newProj`
will have both those variable set to false.

Take a minute to read through this code, then we’ll go through it
step-by-step.

```bash
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]  # while number of args ($#) > (-gt) 0
do                    # do everything between here and 'done'
case $1 in # start of switch statement, switching on next parameter
  -j | --javascript ) # if next var is -j or --javascript
    JS=true           # set the $JS variable to true
    shift             # shift the position of the arguments by 1
    ;;
  -g | --git ) # if next var = -g or --git
    GIT=true   # set the $GIT variable to true
    shift      # shift the position of the arguments along by 1
    ;;
  *)
    DIRNAME=$1 # set any other param as the directory name
    shift      # shift the position of the arguments along by 1
esac; # end switch statement (case backwards)
done  # end while loop
```

What we have here is a loop which loops over each passed-in parameter
and then checks via a switch statement if that parameter matches
either the Git or JavaScript options. If it does, a corresponding
variable is set to true. If it doesn’t, we set that param as the
directory name (`*` means ‘anything else’).

The `shift` command is a slightly strange one. It tells the computer
to shift all the arguments being passed along by one position. This
allows the loop to step through each passed in parameter in turn. You
can read more about `switch`
[here]([https://www.computerhope.com/unix/bash/shift.htm]).

The loop keeps running while the condition inside `[[ ]]` is true.
`$#` is the number of arguments, decreasing by one each loop thanks to
the `shift` commands and `-gt` is the greater-than operator (\<).

It’s also worth pointing out that the catch-all statement at the end
where we set `DIRNAME` isn’t completely idiot-proof. If we run
`./new-proj.sh projA projB` the script will only run for `projB`. You
could throw this as an error (see below) or create multiple repos but
we’ll just bear this in mind for now.

### Error Catching

What we do want to check though, is that at least one directory name
has been passed. This snippet checks to see if the `$DIRNAME` variable
is set and throws an error if it isn’t.

```bash
# exit if directory name isn't set
if [ -z ${DIRNAME+x} ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Could not find a directory name"
  exit 1
fi
```

`exit 0` signals the completion of the program. Exiting with any other
number is an error. So all `exit 1` tells us is that the program
failed.

### Functions

To clean our code up a bit, let’s create some functions to extract the
JavaScript and Git setup logic.

```bash
setup-git() {
  echo "Setting up Git"
  if [[ $1 = true ]]; then # first param is $JS's value
    # add JS relevant lines to .gitignore
    echo "node_modules" >> $DIRNAME/.gitignore
    echo "dist" >> $DIRNAME/.gitignore
  fi
  git init --quiet $DIRNAME
}
```

```bash
setup-js() {
  echo "Setting up JavaScript"
  # create index.js
  touch "$DIRNAME"/index.js
  # change working directory to our passed in directoyr name
  cd $DIRNAME
  # init package.json and yarn, auto-answer yes to all Qs
  yarn init --silent --yes
  # jump back to level above
  cd ..
}
```

All this does is wrap our code from before in an executable, named
block. `setup-js` takes no params, whereas the first param of
`setup-git` is the value of `$JS` which we can use to create
js-relevant lines in `.gitignore`.

Our final step is to run these functions, conditional on the value of
our `$JS` and `$GIT` variables.

```bash
if [ "$JS" = true ]; then
  setup-js
fi

if [ "$GIT" = true ]; then
  setup-git "$JS"
fi
```

That’s it! You can find the completed script as a gist
[here](https://gist.github.com/mulholo/6d3930847ccbb072d89ecedad40f6e37).

`./new-proj.sh -g -j myProj` will create a new project folder with git
and javascript setup, `./new-proj.sh myProj` will create a new project
folder with just a css and html file (and any other combo you like). A
nice, reusable and flexible Bash script.

### Making the Script Runnable from Anywhere

The one final step is to make sure we can run this script from
anywhere; at the moment we have to either be in the same directory as
the script or manually type in a long path to get to it.

There’s a quick solution: all we have to do is copy the script to a
globally executable location. `usr/local/bin` fits this description so
let’s copy the script there, cutting off that awkward `.sh` (remember
us adding `#!/bin/bash` at the top of the file so we don’t need
`.sh`?).

```bash
$ cp new-proj.sh /usr/local/bin/new-proj
```

Now you can create new projects from anywhere on your system!
